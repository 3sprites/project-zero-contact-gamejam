This game was made by a 3 member team.
This was made for a game jam under the theme "Zero Contact".
Game name Whispers in the woods.
EXE 2025 Game Jam (University) organized by levelstair https://exe.levelstair.com.
Won the 2nd place.
All sprites, audio are under the directory assets. 
All scenes are under the directory scenes. 
All the scripts are under the directory scripts.
Since this is the first game we made the game is not optimized properly. And spaghetti code all over the place.

submitted game to the itch.io before minor bug fixes https://itch.io/jam/exe-2025-university/rate/3834793
